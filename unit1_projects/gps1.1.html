          <h3>What is it?</h3>
          <p>It is an opportunity for two developers to work collaboratively on the same piece of code, usually using one computer and two screens. This is a common practice in many large tech companies.</p>

          <h3>Why is it impoortant to Dev Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>The most compelling argument for pairing in a learning environment is that you learn better by teaching. Pairing is a great opportunity to both learn and teach.</p>

          <h3>Defining Driver and Navigator</h3>
          <div id="driver">
              <h4>Driver</h4>
              <p>The driver types the code. They are in charge of the keyboard and mouse and ensure the code is written properly.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="navigator">
              <h4>Navigator</h4>
              <p>The navigator tells the driver what to type.</p>
          </div>

          <p>We didn't want a footer but we had to clear our float.</p>

			I'm including this comment to reflect on the pairing because we had to stop after an hour and didn't get to the reflection part as a pair, but I think it's important.

			My first time pairing was very unfocused, in no small part because we were at vastly different points in the curriculum and couldn't really decide on what to tackle, and then how to tackle it in an effective way as a non-code assignment (the wireframing).

			I did enjoy it though. My pair was easy to talk to and definitely someone I would pair with again. As I said, we were not very focused. And we could have done a better job defining and then sticking to roles as driver/navigator.

			It says somewhere in the handbook that the more experienced person should drive and less experienced person should navigate, but I think that's a bit backwards for how I learn. As the less experienced person, I think having someone explain to me what I need to write and having the chance to get my fingers practicing that code would be more beneficial. Assuming there is plenty of back-and-forth with questions, clarifications, explanations, etc.
