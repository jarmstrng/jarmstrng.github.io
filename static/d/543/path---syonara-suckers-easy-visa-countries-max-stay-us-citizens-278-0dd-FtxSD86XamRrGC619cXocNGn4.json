But the thought of going &#8220;home&#8221; to the US <em>made me shudder</em>.</p>\n<p>I asked myself,</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote-center\">\n<p><em>What countries have the longest tourist visa??</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Well, once I had the idea I just had to find out.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a visual, detail-oriented person, so I spent&#8230; more hours than I&#8217;d care to mention&#8230; looking up the visa requirements for every country I could find on Google Maps (some of them are kinda small, so no promises). Then I made a <strong>color-coded guide</strong> to the easy, long visas.</p>\n<p>I was pretty pleased by how it turned out, but I wanted more. I added the shorter visas as well. More hours of my life, gone. Good thing it was mildly fascinating to read about all the crazy visa rules different countries have.</p>\n<p>And then I thought, why keep this beautiful information to myself? Surely some other traveler will want a quick, visual reference to up-to-date visa info (as of Oct 2013, anyway). I&#8217;m 99% sure this map doesn&#8217;t exist anywhere else.</p>\n<p><em><strong>So I present to you, <a title=\"Visa on Arrival Map for US Citizens\" href=\"https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/edit?mid=ziOm3ydDa534.k5AoDklXdgdo\" target=\"_blank\">the Easy Visas for US Citizens Map</a>.</strong></em></p>\n<p>I would like to extend a special thank you to Google for creating such an awesome maps tool that I can do something like this and share it with you all for no dinero.</p>\n<p>Peeps: definitely let me know if something changes or I have bad intel.</p>\n<p><strong>Share it with your friends</strong>, ya&#8217;ll.
