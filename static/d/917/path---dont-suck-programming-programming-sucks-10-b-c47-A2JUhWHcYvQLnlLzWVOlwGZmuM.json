It reminded me of how bummed I would get as a beginner when something would go wrong.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://twitter.com/devbootcamp/status/603714348452818944\" target=\"_blank\">Just because it&#8217;s hard doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re bad at it.</a></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN43sCyEanA\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sucking-At-Something-Is-The-First-Step-To-Being-Good-At-Something-In-Adventure-Time-Quote-Gif.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\" title=\"You Don't Suck at Programming; Programming Sucks\" width=\"474\" height=\"266\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think <a href=\"https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5\" target=\"_blank\">this AMAZING piece</a> by Alicia Liu sums it up best:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are two characteristics of coding that can make programmers feel like they’re really struggling, <strong>when actually they could be doing just fine</strong>.</p>\n<p>The first thing with programming is that you’re almost guaranteed to have to learn new things as you’re doing it&#8230; This can have the effect that one is constantly feeling behind, and that there is an ever-growing amount of stuff to learn.</p>\n<p>The second characteristic that’s somewhat unique to programming is that it consists of near constant failure.</p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5\" target=\"_blank\">Overcoming Impostor Syndrome, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Coding</a> (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote>\n<p>A while back I wrote a post on <a title=\"How To Be More Than A Stereotype\" href=\"http://helveticajessica.com/stereotype/\">counteracting stereotype threat</a>.

But he stuck with it.
