This CSS design was heavily lifted from the Creative Commons "Handcrafted" by Elliot Jay Stocks on CSS Zen Garden at http://www.csszengarden.com/217//


	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

		<div class="preamble" id="zen-preamble" role="article">
    <p>When you're searching through a database with millions of entries, things can get rather slow, and you'll want to make sure you're optimizing your queries. Of course, like many situations in technology, it is important to weigh the time spent optimizing vs the potential decrease in query time gained from that optimization.</p>

    <p>There are query optimizers that will do the work for you, but as they are only as smart as a computer can be, you can often give them "hints" to guide their direction.</p>

    <p>Logical optimization uses changes to the algorithm to decrease query time, as opposed to "physical" optimization. Some things to keep in mind when writing queries are join order and the use of nested queries, as both of these have the potential to slow things down.</p>

    <p>It is easy to do a Google search and find many different lists of techniques to try to optimize your query, so I won't attempt to create yet another one, but some examples include using the names of columns instead of *, and avoiding functions in the where clause, as it must perform the function on every piece of data before deciding whether or not to use it (seek alternate approaches instead).</p>

    <p>Also, "if you optimizer does take the order into account, then you would want the predicate that eliminates the higher number of rows to be evaluated first by the optimizer." (http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/database-sql/how-to-tune-sql-queries-2/)</p>

			<h3>NoSQL Database Systems</h3>
    <p>If SQL isn't fast enough for you, an alternative to SQL-style databases is "NoSQL", which is simply the term given to every other kind of database. Some examples include document-based databases and key-value databases. These different styles have the potential to be faster than SQL and can have better scalability, but have drawbacks ranging from increased likelihood of data inconsistency to inability to use very complex queries. </p>

    <p>Needless to say, it is important to look at each new project individually to determine which type of database is the best fit for the project's requirements.</p>

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
			<p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
			<p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>), but we ask you release your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons license identical to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" title="View the Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your work.</p>
