			<h3>Reflections on Blogging and Feedback</h3>
			<p><em><time datetime="2014-07-23">23 July 2014</time></em></p>

			<p>My first experience with writing a blog was a travel journal I started in early 2013, which I abandoned after a half-dozen posts, realizing that I was spending several hours on each post and getting almost no feedback. It didn't seem worth the effort and I wasn't sure that anyone (myself or my readers) was really getting anything out of it.</p>

			<p>Later, I became editor for my employer's blog on home downsizing. I learned a lot about the particulars of writing for the web, from use of whitespace and lists, to the importance of using stories and anecdotes, to making sure you're actually solving people's problems.</p>

			<p>Also, I had to keep a journal for a couple classes when I was in college. That was a valuable experience that deepened my understanding of the material, and showed me how important reflection can be.</p>

			<p>My blogging experience for DevBootcamp, though, has been a rather uncomfortable hybrid between the two. It is not pure reflection, as it must be written for an audience and is therefore excessively self-aware and lacking deep exploration. And yet it's not quite something that many readers might derive value from either, as it's too close to the self-absorbed reflection of journaling.</p>

			<p>Sadly, many of my posts have also been rushed due to a need to finish all if my assignments on time, and were not inspired by a deep desire to express something that I think people should know (which can be very helpful in writing compelling content).</p>

			<h3>Going Forward</h3>

			<p>That being said, I have used the opportunity to learn about new subjects, like the history of JavaScript, and have been getting practice with HTML and CSS. I certainly have benefited from the experience, though not in the pure-reflective-journaling or pure-writing-to-help-people sort of way.</p>

			<p>My hope is that I will be able to spend some time re-writing my existing posts to make them more compelling and useful. I would like to add anecdotes, examples, and deeper explanations. As a beginner programmer with writing experience, I am able to explain introductory concepts much more clearly than a lot of what you can find on Google now (ranking on Google is another matter, of course).<p>

			<p>In the meantime, I would like to keep a beginner-friendly approach in the forefront of my mind. I will try my best not to let a time crunch force me to post something that I consider having lackluster writing and being useless to a reader.</p> 

			<p>To be candid, though - I'm at DBC to learn how to code, not how to write. I can focus my energies on becoming the next big thing in beginner's Ruby blogging <em>after</em> I graduate.</p>
