    <h1>DevBootcamp Pairing & Feedback Q&A</h1>
    <h2>A Student's Perspective</h2>
    <p><em>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</em></p>
	<p>Pairing is good. I'm enjoying the opportunity to meet my cohort and access another brain for the sake of problemsolving. Having the opportunity to give and receive feedback is great, and the Feedbackinator has a lot of good points - anonymity and filtering out unkind feedback - though I think it has the potential to evolve into something a even more useful.</p>
	<h3>Pairing</h3>
	<p><em>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</em></p> 
	<p>Each session has been different, certainly presenting a variety of learning experiences, whether cultural or technical. I'm glad to have to opportunity to figure out what works best before we get into the meat of the program.</p>
	<p><em>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</em></p> 
	<p>The pairing session I enjoyed most was the one where my pair and I were at similar levels of understanding in the language, so neither of us had to take over/guide the session entirely, and we were both brainstorming and coming up with solutions equally. Having one person significantly ahead of the other makes for a rather lopsided session, and while that's still useful it seems there's more camaraderie and teamwork when the skill levels are similar.</p>
	<p><em>Was something frustrating and difficult for you? </em></p>
	<p>The most frustrating pairing session was when I'd been having trouble with something and then our "guide" kind of bulldozed our getting-to-know-you conversation at the beginning and my pair and I became rather flustered. We never quite clicked and I think that having the opportunity to finish our chat and then discuss expectations for the session would have made it go more smoothly.</p>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p><em>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</em></p> 
	<p>I couldn't help but try to guess who had left what feedback, and some of them I was pretty sure and some of them less-so. It was interesting to see how people approached leaving feedback with different styles - the positive:constructive ratio and how specific they were - and they ranged from non-specific/constructive cheerleading, to only-constructive.</p>
	<p><em>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</em></p> 
	<p>Feedback for me has mostly centered around needing to vocalize more, which I knew was going to be something to work on as I'm not used to thinking out loud with strangers. I've been making an effort to stay conscious of whether or not I'm verbalizing my thoughts and also encouraging my pairs to do the same. It definitely helps the conversation but I have mixed feelings about it helping my learning, because I have to divert some of my mental energy from the problem at hand and can't focus quite as well. But when I explain my ideas my pair is more likely to pick them up and help take them further and that is definitely beneficial.</p>
	<p><em>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</em></p> 
	<p>As I said, I'm working on vocalizing my thought process. I also got an interesting bit of feedback that made me realize that my identification as a "smart" person is partially tied to the assumption that I need to understand something right away, and so when I don't figure something out as quickly as I like, I am more likely to become frustrated. I've started taking breaks to work on something else when I'm feeling stuck, before I get to the point where I've become very frustrated and that seems to help.</p>
	<p><em>How was it to write feedback?</em></p> 
	<p>Writing feedback is tricky, and I've noticed that a lot of people have difficulty being specific and giving actionable feedback. There's a lot of "I liked working with you!" and then some vague mention of something that could have gone better but no suggestion for what exactly might be done to make it better next time.</p>
	<p><em>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</em></p> 
	<p>I've found that depending on how the session went, I have to stretch for either positive or constructive feedback. Also, I'll think of something that the other person could have done better and then immediately see how I might have made it better myself. So a lot of my constructive feedback has been "we should have...", which is actually pretty helpful for myself. I'm not sure if it dilutes the feedback from their perspective, or if it's simply communicating that we're all in this together, or how exactly it comes off. The "actionable" aspect is definitely the hardest to come up with and sometimes I nearly forget to include it.</p>
	<h3>Suggestions</h3>
	<p><em>Do you have any suggestions for improvement?</em></p>
	<p>I wish we were able to start by pairing in person instead of via video call. I'm looking forward to having built relationships with my pairs and not feeling like we have to chat for 15 min before we're ready to get to work. As an American it feels inefficient but as a human being it feels necessary. I think that once I've spent more time with folks we won't have to spend quite so much time checking in.</p>
	<p>I would like to be able to give feedback on people's feedback directly. Then we can remind them that they're not supposed to use the person's name(!) I can understand that we want to make sure people know how to be kind with their feedback before the receiver has to see it, but at the same time it would be good to be able to ask clarifying questions, and to toughen our skins a bit. It would be great to get to a point where we can just give feedback to people directly. It feels a little too coddling this way.  Maybe guided feedback sessions where someone acts as moderator would be helpful. Or simply being able to see how your feedback was rated and then having the opportunity to revise it.</p>
