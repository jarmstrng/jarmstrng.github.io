    <h1>SQL Query Optimization</h1>

    <p>When you're searching through a database with millions of entries, things can get rather slow, and you'll want to make sure you're optimizing your queries. Of course, like many situations in technology, it is important to weigh the time spent optimizing vs the potential decrease in query time gained from that optimization.</p>

    <p>There are query optimizers that will do the work for you, but as they are only as smart as a computer can be, you can often give them "hints" to guide their direction.</p>

    <p>Logical optimization uses changes to the algorithm to decrease query time, as opposed to "physical" optimization. Some things to keep in mind when writing queries are join order and the use of nested queries, as both of these have the potential to slow things down.</p>

    <p>It is easy to do a Google search and find many different lists of techniques to try to optimize your query, so I won't attempt to create yet another one, but some examples include using the names of columns instead of *, and avoiding functions in the where clause, as it must perform the function on every piece of data before deciding whether or not to use it (seek alternate approaches instead). Also, "if you optimizer does take the order into account, then you would want the predicate that eliminates the higher number of rows to be evaluated first by the optimizer."

    <h2>NoSQL Database Systems</h2>

    <p>If SQL isn't fast enough for you, an alternative to SQL-style databases is "NoSQL", which is simply the term given to every other kind of database. Some examples include document-based databases and key-value databases. These different styles have the potential to be faster than SQL and can have better scalability, but have drawbacks ranging from increased likelihood of data inconsistency to inability to use very complex queries. </p>

    <p>Needless to say, it is important to look at each new project individually to determine which type of database is the best fit for the project's requirements.</p>
