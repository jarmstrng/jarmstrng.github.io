Conflict can be useful, since it can push conflicting parties to grow and communicate, and it can improve conflicting ideas. However, this can only happen if we understand why the conflict is there in the first place. Once we've identified the root of the problem, we can take the right steps to resolve it.

According to psychologists Art Bell and Brett Hart, there are eight common causes of conflict in the workplace. Bell and Hart identified these common causes in separate articles on workplace conflict in 2000 and 2002.

The eight causes are:

Conflicting resources.
Conflicting styles.
Conflicting perceptions.
Conflicting goals.
Conflicting pressures.
Conflicting roles.
Different personal values.
Unpredictable policies.

Poor Communication
Different Values
Differing Interests
Scarce Resources
Personality Clashes
Poor Performance

Different Values: any workplace is made up of individuals who see the world differently. Conflict occurs when there is a lack of acceptance and understanding of these differences.
Differing Interests: conflict occurs when individual workers ‘fight’ for their personal goals, ignoring organizational goals and organizational well-being.

Avoidance
Collaboration
Compromise
Competing
Accommodation

Clearly articulate the causes of the conflict – openly acknowledging there will be differing perceptions of the problem(s).
Make a clear statement of why you want the conflict resolved and reasons to work on conflict.
Communication of how you want the conflict resolved.
Address the issues face-to-face (notes, email correspondence, memos are not a productive way to resolve differences).
Stick to the issues. In trying to resolve conflict, it is tempting to resort to name calling or bring up issues from the past. It is important to address specific behaviors and situations if change is to take place.
Take time out if necessary. In the resolution of a conflict, our emotions may interfere with arriving at a productive resolution. If this transpires, take a time-out and resume resolving the conflict at another designated time.

Withdrawal
Attack Self
Avoidance
Attack Other

At the North end of the Compassis “Withdrawal”. It
is hiding from others and living in fear of exposure
of what we perceive as a defect or weakness. It leads
to isolation and gradual absorption into a darker
insulated world. It would tend to defeat our human
need to belong, for sake of survival.

When confronted with shame in our adult years... The
most mature of us begin an inner search of memories for times when we felt truly accepted and loved, and
are able to recover our equilibrium and even learn something more about ourselves and about the part that was
exposed.

Humility can be a path leading away from the poles of this compass and bringing us to healthier ways
of living and relating. We can move from shame to humility when we allow ourselves to feel accepted and
loved with all our flaws, all our vulnerabilities and failures. Humility can enable us to preserve our attachment
to relationships and groups that mean safety and security to us. By striving for humility, we can make the
choice to be autonomous and authentic, without diminishing ourselves or destroying the possibility of
relationship in our interpersonal worlds.
===========================================================

Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
Not too long ago, I had an employer ask me to share our email list with an important B2B client, so that he could email them as well.

What was the source of the conflict?
I felt that it would be a violation of trust to give out the email addresses of our customers. I also felt it would dilute the impact of our emails, as people are already struggling with information overload on the internet, and would potentially undo some of the hard work we had put in collecting email addresses in the first place. 
At the same time, it was important - almost more important from a strictly financial, short-term point of view - to maintain a good relationship with this client. Also, my employer had already agreed to do it. 
There were too many reasons I couldn't simply say "No." And yet I felt very strongly that I needed to protect the small-town style relationship that we had with the customers who had entrusted us with their email addresses. Everyone with email has had it shared or sold without their express permission, so it was no large leap in empathy for me to suspect that it would not be appreciated. 

How did you handle that conflict?
First, I considered the real goal of the client who wanted our list: he wanted to be able to reach out to customers to tell them about new products.
I researched the legality of sharing email addresses, looking up the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and the terms laid forth by our email marketing service. There was a lot of gray area, but I found enough to be able to make an argument against sharing the list - approaching it from a legal standpoint so as to prevent it from becoming personal.
Then I came up with an alternative solution that would still enable him meet his true goal: we could include information about his new products in our own emails, including photos and a link to his website. If he had something set up to collect email addresses we could promote that as well, so that he could build his own list.
I took this information to my employer first, to make an argument for not sharing the list, and got approval to take it to the client next. 

Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
I sent a very personable and well-reasoned email to the client explaining how we wanted to help him reach out to customers but would be unable to do it by giving him our email list, for these specific legal reasons. I laid out several options for things we could do to help him promote his business, and said we would be more than happy to help him in these ways.
He took it very well and sent me some information to be included in the next email. As of this writing, he is still one of the business's biggest clients and seems to be doing well. 

If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
Frankly, I wish we had included something on our sign-up sheet that promised we would never share email addresses. It would have saved a lot of time researching the legality of the matter, and may have prevented us from being in that position in the first place. 

What did you learn from this experience?
It confirmed something I already suspected: if you truly take another person's best interests to heart, it is 100% possible to take a potentially difficult conversation and turn it into an opportunity for real win-win solutions.
It also confirmed the strength of my feelings about integrity in the workplace, as I was ready to reconsider my position at that company if I had been forced to act in a way that was incongruent with my values. Fortunately, being able to empathize with the client and my employer allowed me to come up with a solution that didn't violate my integrity. I believe that approach can be successful even in businesses that don't have a history of small-town trust and integrity.
