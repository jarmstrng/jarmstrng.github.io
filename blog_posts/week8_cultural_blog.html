<p>Not too long ago, I had an employer ask me to share our email list with an important B2B client, so that he could email them as well.

<p>This was a difficult situation for me. I felt that it would be a violation of trust to give out the email addresses of our customers. I also felt it would dilute the impact of our emails, as people are already struggling with information overload on the internet, and sharing the list might negate the hard work we had put in collecting email addresses in the first place. 
<p>At the same time, it was important - almost more important from a strictly financial, short-term point of view - to maintain a good relationship with this client. And to make things worse, my boss had already agreed to do it. 
<p>There were too many reasons I couldn't simply say "No." And yet I felt very strongly that I needed to protect the small-town style relationship that we had with the customers who had entrusted us with their email addresses. Everyone with email has had it shared or sold without their express permission at some time or another, so it was no large leap in empathy for me to suspect that it might not be appreciated by our customers. 

<h3>What to do?</h3>
<p>First, I considered the real goal of the client who wanted our list: he wanted to be able to reach out to customers to tell them about new products.
<p>To prevent it from becoming personal, I approaching it from a legal standpoint. I researched the legality of sharing email addresses, looking up the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and the terms laid forth by our email marketing service. There was a lot of gray area, but I found enough to be able to make an argument against sharing the list.
<p>Then I came up with an alternative solution that would still enable our client meet his end goal: we could include information about his new products in our own emails, including photos and a link to his website. We could promote his email list as well, so that he could use our own highly targeted list to help build his from scratch.
<p>I took this information to my employer to make an argument for not sharing the list, and was given approval to take it to the client next. 

<h3>The results</h3>
<p>I sent a very personable and well-reasoned email to the client explaining how we wanted to help him reach out to customers but would be unable to do it by giving him our email list, for several specific legal reasons. I laid out several options for things we could do to help him promote his business, and said we would be more than happy to help him in these ways.
<p>He took it very well and sent me some information to be included in the next email. As of this writing, he is still one of the business's biggest clients and seems to be doing well. 

<h3>Learning from life</h3>
<p>Frankly, I wish we had included something on our sign-up sheet that promised we would never share email addresses. It would have saved a lot of time researching the legality of the matter, and may have prevented us from being in that position in the first place. 

<p>The experience confirmed something I already suspected: if you really, truly take another person's best interests to heart, it is 100% possible to take a potentially difficult conversation and turn it into an opportunity for real win-win solutions.
<p>It also confirmed the strength of my feelings about integrity in the workplace, as I was ready to reconsider my position at that company if I had been forced to act in a way that was incongruent with my values. Fortunately, being able to empathize with the client and my employer allowed me to come up with a solution that didn't violate my integrity. I believe that approach can be successful even in businesses that don't have a history of small-town trust and integrity.</p>
