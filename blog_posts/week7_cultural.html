    <h1>The Value of Continued Learning</h1>
    
    <p><em>Assignment: Identify values that are important to you. Explain how you will use affirmation to help you succeed.</em></p>

<h4>When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which values come to mind?</h4>

<p>Personally: learning, growth, integrity. Interpersonally: curiosity, helping.</p>

<h4>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</h4>

<p>I believe that learning, growth, and curiosity are three interrelated values that have shaped my life in the ways that I am most proud of. A voracious appetite for learning has resulted in:</p>

<p><ul><li>reading or skimming every book relating to sustainable architecture (even tangentially) in my small-town library (plus plenty of books on other subjects)</li>
<li>embracing MOOCs as soon as they became available</li>
<li>using internet resources to teach myself how to fill a role as a professional digital content manager</li>
<li>traveling to 13 countries in 12 months on a modest budget</li>
<li>successfully teaching preschoolers developmental gymnastics and karate despite having no background</li>
<li>going from no experience with the Spanish language to functional in countries with few English speakers</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Without this curiosity and impulse to learn more, my life up to this point would not have been nearly as interesting or fulfilling.</p>

<h4>In general, I try to live up to these values: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</h4>

<p>Frankly, I try to live each of these values to my core. The only thing I would change right now is that I don't spend as much time as I would like helping others in a large-scale, societal way. I embrace opportunities to help the people who are in my life now, but when I am finished with DevBootcamp and have more time I want to return to volunteer or nonprofit work.</p>

<h4>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h4>

<p>I recently had to teach my former coworkers how to take over my job duties, and so I spent several hours showing them how to use WordPress, photo editing software, and Constant Contact's email marketing services - all things I had to teach myself when I first started the job, as the position didn't exist at that company until I was hired. It was necessary not only to teach the skills, but to encourage them to adopt an exploratory mindset and not be afraid to poke around with the tools to see what could be done.

<h4>How do you feel when you think about your values?</h4>

<p>When I think about my values (those listed above as well as others), I feel empowered to do what I need to do in life to make things happen and improve them.</p>

<h4>Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h4>

<p>If the stereotype is one that suggests I might be incapable of reaching my goals, remembering my history of success with learning, integrity, and helping would likely lessen that threat.</p>

<h4>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h4>

<p>As "helping" is important to me, I have found that existential angst and many frustrations can be decreased via charitable donations to causes I feel strongly about. I have several people in my life who are important to me and who believe strongly that I will succeed at DBC and in getting a job afterwards, and speaking with them is always a good when I'm frustrated by the work. And, of course, maintaining healty habits like getting a good night's sleep and sufficient nutrition go a long way in preventing "feeling down."</p>

	<p>Curiosity; Helping

	<p>Ever been in a situation where 















    <p>Writing about one's values can be a great journal exercise, but makes for a rather self-indulgent blog topic. I mean, does anybody really care what I value? Is it worth their time to read my babbling on about values, when there are literally millions of other things to read on the web that might better entertain, educate, enlighten them?</p>

    <p>Frankly, probably not. Which is why I'm not going to write about what I value. This blog post is about why you should value learning, growth, and curiosity.</p>

    <p>When I was younger I held a leadership position at a small regional office for a nonprofit organization. I really believed in what we were doing and was doing a really good job and facilitating my coworkers' success as well.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, at that time I had limited experience working with people of other cultures. One of my subordinates seemed resentful of my position of leadership and, long story short, bullied and belittled me in front of the rest of the staff.</p>

    <p>If I had been more familiar with this other culture I would have been better able to express respect in a way that this person valued.
