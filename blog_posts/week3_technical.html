<h2>JavaScript - The Big JS</h2>
<p>As a novice in the programming world, if someone asks me why JavaScript (JS) is so popular right now, I’m going to turn to Google and see what the world wide web has to tell me about the matter.</p>

<p>In the first-page articles that The Google recommended, I came across three recurring themes that even a non-programmer can understand:</p>

<p>It’s fast
<br>It’s easy
<br>It’s ubiquitous</p>

<p>Let’s start with the speed argument. </p>

<p>The days of dial-up internet are behind us (thank heavens). Consumers of the web want shiny and fast, and JavaScript can give that to them. </p>

<p>But was JavaScript always fast?</p>

<p>According to good ol’ Wikipedia*, back when flannel shirts were all the rage Netscape engineer Brendan Eich developed JavaScript.</p>

<p>It was first released for “server-side” use - the under-the-hood programming that you don’t see - in 1994, then for “client-side” use in 1995. That means Netscape actually put it inside their web browser, and the very next year Microsoft did the same* (but renamed it for trademark purposes). The year after that, it became standardized by Ecma International*, one of those nonprofits that gets to decide what “standardized” means.</p>

<p>My mentor-of-sorts* argues that JavaScript was not always fast, but rather was heavily invested in because of its ubiquity.</p>

<p>A series of improvements to JavaScript were made, and named Ajax in 2005, that allow for “asynchronous” processing in JS. Web pages and web servers can now have 100s of different conversations at the same time, instead of having to wait for one conversation to finish before the next one starts.</p>

<p>When the Mozilla Firefox browser came out in 2004, they included usage of JavaScript (the standardized version anyway), and Google even built a special tool to make JS even faster for their 2008 Chrome browser.</p>

<p>One version of the “easy” argument, by Jerry Bradenbaugh*, author of the Javascript Application Cookbook:<p>

<p>“Adding JavaScript to your site doesn't require having access to a server, compiling programs, or having the browser load a virtual machine. You simply add JavaScript to your web pages and upload the page. Running the program is as simple as reloading the page in a browser.”<p>

<p>So why is JavaScript easy? Because it’s self-contained in the browser. Or, because there are now a lot of resources* available to make it easy.<p>

<p>I think JavaScript is as popular as it is because it’s the only language that is built in to every single browser (in one form* or another*). The web has exploded in popularity and as people want and need more sophisticated web pages, they’re going to turn to a programming language that is available within every single browser. There is also a shift towards web-based services, for example online-based Google Drive replacing the desktop software of Microsoft Office, and towards cloud-based computing that is often accessed via browser.<p>

<p>But where are the pain-points, you ask? To be honest, a lot of them are pretty much impossible for a novice programmer to explain to a non-programmer.<p>

<p>I, personally, think it’s rather ugly. What’s {up} with all the {curly{brackets?}} And whoa semicolons.<p>

<p>A little sample piece of code from my JavaScript homework:<p>

<p>for (i = 0; i < clientsList.length; i++)  {
  <br>console.log("The client's name is " + clientsList[i].name + ".”);}</p>

<p>An equivalent in Ruby, another programming language enjoying popularity right now:<p>

<p>for client in clientsList
  <br>puts “The client’s name is #{client}.”</p>

<p>(You Rubyists will have to excuse me if you would rather use each - my Ruby is still a bit beginner-Pythonic.)<p>

<p>Another thing about JavaScript that can be less-than-fun: it isn’t actually standardized between the different browsers. If you write something in JavaScript you then need to make little adaptations so it will definitely work with JScript, blah blah blah. <p>
