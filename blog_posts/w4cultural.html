    <h1>The Problem of Software Patents:</h1> 
    <p>An important topic within computing is software patents. The relevance of software patents to the current state of computing cannot be over emphasized, and 2009, the year of the Bilski case was an especially important year.</p> 
    <p>If you're not familiar with them, understand that they could best be described as a license preventing others from making software that performs the same function as the patented software. The most important thing to know about software patents is that there is both the potential to discourage companies innovating because they might not be able to protect their ideas (and therefore revenue), as well as the potential to limit innovation from overly-vague patents.</p> 
    <p>In my experience, I have witnessed software companies using and contributing to open source software while keeping their "secret sauce" algorithms safe from infringement through private directories and non-disclosure agreements with their employees. To me, this seems a practical solution that allows for the sharing of ideas that contributes to the exponential progress made in software development, while preventing others from stealing or copy/pasting those ideas which differentiate the product.</p> 
    <p>I think the most interesting argument against software patents (irregardless of whether the argument is useful in court), is that "software is math" and "since math is not patentable, neither is software.". Going forward, there is going to be a hell of a battle between the traditional companies that rely on patents to protect their ideas (while also taking advantage of open source resources), and those less-traditional companies who embrace open source fully.. </p>
